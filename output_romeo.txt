		'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
		'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
		'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
		A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
		A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
		A fair assembly.
		A hall,a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
		A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
		A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.
		A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
		A villain, that is hither come in spite,
		A visard for a visard! what care I
		A was a merry man, took up the child.
		A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
		Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
		After the prompter, for our entrance.
		Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
		Ah, sirrah [to Second Capulet], by my fay, it waxes late;
		Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
		Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
		Am I the master here, or you? go to.
		Among fresh female buds shall you this night
		An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
		An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
		An she agree, within her scope of choice
		And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
		And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
		And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
		And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
		And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
		And hear the sentence of your moved Prince.
		And if you be not of the house of Montagues,
		And in this state she gallops night by night.
		And like her most whose merit most shall be.
		And made Verona's ancient citizens
		And makes himself an artificial night.
		And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
		And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
		And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
		And private in his chamber pens himself;
		And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
		And see how one another lends content;
		And she as much in love, her means much less
		And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
		And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
		And she was wean'd, I never shall forget it.
		And since that time it is eleven years;
		And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
		And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
		And stole into the covert of the wood.
		And the continuance of their parents' rage,
		And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
		And the rank poison of the old will die.
		And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
		And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
		And then my husband, God be with his soul!
		And these,who, often drown'd, could never die.
		And to them say;
		And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
		And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
		And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
		And young affection gapes to be his heir;
		And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
		And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
		And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
		And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
		And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd.
		And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
		And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
		And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
		Antony! and Potpan!
		Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.
		Are made already mothers: by my count
		As is the bud bit with an envious worm
		As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
		At my poor house look to behold this night
		Away from light steals home my heavy son,
		Be quiet, or..More light, more light! For shame!
		Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
		Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
		Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
		Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
		Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
		Being held a foe, he may not have access
		Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
		Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
		Benvolio. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
		Benvolio. Here were the servants of your adversary
		Benvolio. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
		Benvolio. The date is out of such prolixity.
		Benvolio. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
		Benvolio. Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
		Black and portentous must this humour prove,
		But He that hath the steerage of my course
		But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
		But he, his own affections' counsellor,
		But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
		But no more deep will I endart mine eye
		But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
		But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
		But to himself so secret and so close,
		But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
		But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
		But, let them measure us by what they will,
		By having him, making yourself no less.
		By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
		By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
		By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
		By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
		Called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
		Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
		Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
		Capulet. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
		Capulet. But Montague is bound as well as I,
		Capulet. But saying o'er what I have said before.
		Capulet. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
		Capulet. Go to, go to!
		Capulet. He shall be endur'd.
		Capulet. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
		Capulet.Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
		Capulet.What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much.
		Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
		Chorus. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
		Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
		Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
		Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
		Come, go with me.
		Compare her face with some that I shall show,
		Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
		County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; the lady
		Cry but 'Ah me!' pronounce but Love and dove;
		Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
		Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
		Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
		Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
		Dost thou not laugh?
		Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
		Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
		Drawn with a team of little atomies A
		Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
		Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
		Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
		Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
		Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
		Examine every married lineament,
		Farewell, my coz.
		Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
		Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
		Fetch me my rapier, boy. what, dares the slave
		Find written in the margent of his eyes.
		Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
		For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
		For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
		For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
		For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
		For even the day before, she broke her brow.
		For fair without the fair within to hide.
		For men so old as we to keep the peace.
		For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
		For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood.
		For this time, all the rest depart away.
		For you and I are past our dancing days;
		From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
		From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
		From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
		Give me a case to put my visage in. [Putting on a mask.] 
		Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
		Go, sirrah, trudge about
		God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
		Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,
		Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast;
		Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets;
		He bears him like a portly gentleman;
		He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.
		He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
		He that is strucken blind cannot forget
		Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
		Her mother is the lady of the house.
		Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
		Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
		Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
		Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
		Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
		Here in my house do him disparagement.
		Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
		Herself pois'd with herself in either eye.
		His pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
		How long is't now since last yourself and I
		I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
		I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
		I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
		I drew to part them in the instant came
		I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
		I must hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
		I never should forget it; 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
		I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal;
		I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
		I tell you, he that can lay hold of her.
		I thank you, honest gentlemen, good-night.
		I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
		I was your mother much upon these years
		I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,
		I would not for the wealth of all the town.
		I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
		I'll make you quiet. What! cheerly, my hearts.
		I'll to my rest.
		I, measuring his affections by my own,
		If ever you disturb our streets again,
		If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
		In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
		In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
		In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
		Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
		Is it e'en so? why then, I thank you all;
		Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
		Is to himself, I will not say how true,
		It is my will; the which if thou respect,
		It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
		Juliet. I'll look to like, if looking liking move.
		Juliet. My only love sprung from my only hate!
		Juliet.Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
		Lady Capulet.This is the matter:-Nurse, give leave awhile,
		Lady Capulet.Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
		Lady Capulet.What say you? can you love the gentleman?
		Lady Montague. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
		Let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
		Let two more summers wither in their pride
		Lies my consent and fair according voice.
		Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
		Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
		Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
		Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
		Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
		Making them women of good carriage.
		May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
		Mercutio. I mean, sir, in delay
		Mercutio. If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
		Mercutio. Nay, I'll conjure too.
		Mercutio. O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
		Mercutio. This cannot anger him 'twould anger him
		Mercutio. True, I talk of dreams,
		Mercutio. Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word.
		Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
		Montague. Both by myself and many other friends;
		Montague. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
		Montague. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
		More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
		More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
		My child is yet a stranger in the world,
		My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
		My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
		My lord and you were then at Mantua.
		My master is the great rich Capulet;
		My will to her consent is but a part;
		Nay, I do bear a brain. but, as I said,
		Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
		Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
		Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
		Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
		Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
		Not half so big as a round little worm
		Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again.
		Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
		Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
		Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
		Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,
		Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
		Nurse. Now, by my maidenhea, at twelve year old,
		Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
		Nurse. Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
		O anything, of nothing first create!
		O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
		O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight;
		O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
		O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
		O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
		Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
		Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
		Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
		Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
		Of limping winter treads, even such delight
		Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
		Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
		Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
		Of yonder knight?
		On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
		On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
		On the fore-finger of an alderman,
		Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
		One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
		One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
		One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
		One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
		One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
		Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
		Paris.Of honourable reckoning are you both;
		Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
		Person hath here writ. I must to the learned..in good time!
		Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
		Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid.
		Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
		Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
		Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,
		Pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his,
		Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
		Remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.
		Rest you merry!
		Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
		Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
		Romeo. 'Tis the way
		Romeo. A torch for me. let wantons, light of heart,
		Romeo. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
		Romeo. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
		Romeo. I fear, too early. for my mind misgives
		Romeo. Not I, believe me. you have dancing shoes,
		Romeo. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
		Romeo. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
		Romeo. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
		Romeo. Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
		Romeo. What lady is that,
		Romeo. When the devout religion of mine eye
		Romeo. Why, such is love's transgression.
		Romeo.[To Juliet.] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
		Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
		Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
		Sent to find those persons whose names are here
		Servant. Away with the join-stools,
		Servant. Find them out whose names are written here! It is
		Servant. Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
		Servant. Now I'll tell you without asking.
		Shake, quoth the dove-house. 'twas no need, I trow,
		Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
		Shall have the chinks.
		She could have run and waddled all about;
		She hath forsworn to love; and in that vow
		She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
		She is not fourteen. How long is it now
		She is the fairies' midwife; and she comes
		She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
		She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
		She was too good for me. but, as I said,
		She will not stay the siege of loving terms
		She, I'll swear hath corns; am I come near you now?
		Should in the farthest east begin to draw
		Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
		Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
		Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
		Shut up in prison, kept without my food.
		Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
		Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
		Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
		So early walking did I see your son.
		So far from sounding and discovery,
		So shall you share all that he doth possess,
		So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
		So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
		Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
		Some five-and-twenty years; and then we mask'd.
		Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
		Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
		Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
		Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
		Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
		Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
		Such as I love; and you among the store,
		Such as would please; 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.
		Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
		Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
		Susan and she, God rest all Christian souls!
		Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
		Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
		Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
		Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
		That I have worn a visard; and could tell
		That I must love a loathed enemy.
		That I will show you shining at this feast,
		That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
		That fair for which love groan'd for, and would die,
		That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
		That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
		That most are busied when they're most alone,
		That plats the manes of horses in the night;
		That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
		That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
		That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
		That westward rooteth from the city's side,
		That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
		That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
		The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
		The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
		The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
		The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
		The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
		The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
		The fish lives in the sea; and 'tis much pride
		The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
		The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
		The pantry, and everything in extremity.
		The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
		The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
		The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
		The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
		The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
		The which, if you with patient ears attend,
		Then dreams he of another benefice.
		Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
		These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
		This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this.
		This is she.
		This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
		This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
		This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
		This night you shall behold him at our feast;
		This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
		This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
		Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
		Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
		Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
		Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
		Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
		Through fair Verona; find those persons out
		Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
		Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground
		Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
		Tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep,
		Till the prince came, who parted either part.
		Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
		To Lammas-tide?
		To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
		To beautify him, only lacks a cover.
		To bid me trudge.
		To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear;
		To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
		To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
		To know our farther pleasure in this case,
		To meet her new beloved anywhere.
		To merit bliss by making me despair.
		To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
		To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle,
		To scorn at our solemnity this night.
		To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
		To see now how a jest shall come about!
		To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
		To soar with his light feathers; and so bound,
		To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
		To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay.'
		To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
		Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
		Towards him I made; but he was ware of me,
		Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
		Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning.
		Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
		Two households, both alike in dignity,
		Tybalt. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
		Tybalt. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
		Tybalt. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
		Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.
		Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
		Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
		Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
		Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.
		We have a trifling foolish banquet towards..
		We must talk in secret:-Nurse, come back again;
		We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
		We would as willingly give cure as know.
		We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
		We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
		Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
		Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go.
		Were in a mask?
		Were of an age. well, Susan is with God;
		What curious eye doth quote deformities?
		What doth her beauty serve but as a note
		What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
		What is it else? a madness most discreet,
		What, goodman boy! I say he shall go to?
		When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid!
		When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
		When well apparell'd April on the heel
		Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
		Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
		Where shall we dine? O,me! What fray was here?
		Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
		Whereto I have invited many a guest,
		Which are the children of an idle brain,
		Which but their children's end naught could remove,
		Which doth enrich the hand
		Which is as thin of substance as the air,
		Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
		Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
		Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
		Which, among view of many, mine, being one,
		Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
		Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.
		While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
		Whipp'd and tormented and God-den, good fellow.
		Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
		Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
		Whose names are written there,
		Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
		Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
		Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
		Wilt thou not, Jule? it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
		Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
		With Cupid's arrow, she hath Dian's wit;
		With all the admired beauties of Verona.

Romeo. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

Romeo. Can I go forward when my heart is here?

Romeo. I dreamt a dream to-night.
Romeo. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
Romeo. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Romeo. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
Romeo. Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Romeo. Is she a Capulet?
Romeo. Nay, that's not so.
Romeo. Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Romeo. O, teach me how I should forget to think.

Romeo. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
