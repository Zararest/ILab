which 
kak 
Romeo and Juliet enjoy 
Romeo. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
		When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid!
Have at thee, coward!
		I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
		Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Gregory. No, marry; I fear thee!
		Be quiet, or..More light, more light! For shame!
		Person hath here writ. I must to the learned..in good time!
		O anything, of nothing first create!
		Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
		Juliet. My only love sprung from my only hate!
		Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
		To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
		Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
		Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
		And then my husband, God be with his soul!
		You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
		Antony! and Potpan!
		Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
1 Citizen. Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Benvolio. Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
Capulet. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
		Capulet. Go to, go to!
		Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!
		Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
		Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
		Susan and she, God rest all Christian souls!
		Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
		Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
		You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
		That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
		God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
		Romeo. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
		Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
		To see now how a jest shall come about!
		Rest you merry!
Servant. Ye say honestly. rest you merry!
		O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
		And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
		Wilt thou not, Jule? it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
		The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
		To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay.'
		Capulet. But Montague is bound as well as I,
		Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
		The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Juliet. Go ask his name. if he be married,
		She was too good for me. but, as I said,
		Nay, I do bear a brain. but, as I said,
		Nurse. Now, by my maidenhea, at twelve year old,
		To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
		My child is yet a stranger in the world,
		The which, if you with patient ears attend,
		To soar with his light feathers; and so bound,
		Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
		Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Benvolio. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
Romeo. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
		Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
		Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
		Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
		And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
		That westward rooteth from the city's side,
		Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
		And the continuance of their parents' rage,
		That fair for which love groan'd for, and would die,
		Chorus. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
		And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
		To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle,
		Lady Capulet.This is the matter:-Nurse, give leave awhile,
		Towards him I made; but he was ware of me,
		Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
		Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,
		Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
Capulet. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
		In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
		Which, among view of many, mine, being one,
		Capulet. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
		That most are busied when they're most alone,
		Whose names are written there,
		Such as I love; and you among the store,
		To know our farther pleasure in this case,
		But to himself so secret and so close,
		Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
Nurse. An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
		A villain, that is hither come in spite,
		By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
		Is to himself, I will not say how true,
		The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
		Which but their children's end naught could remove,
		Black and portentous must this humour prove,
		Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
		Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
		We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
		Benvolio. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
		For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
		Juliet.Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
		For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
		By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
		Nurse. Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Romeo. Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
		Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
		Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,
		Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
		Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
		In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
		Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,
		And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
		I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,
		Romeo. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Romeo. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
		Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
		But, let them measure us by what they will,
		Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
		You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
		O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
		Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
		Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
		On the fore-finger of an alderman,
		Montague. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
		If ever you disturb our streets again,
		But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
		Which are the children of an idle brain,
		Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
		And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
		Away from light steals home my heavy son,
		I, measuring his affections by my own,
Romeo. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
		'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
		And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
		Tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep,
		By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
		More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
		A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
		That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
		Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
		This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
		Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
		Which is as thin of substance as the air,
		Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
		She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
		One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
		Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
		But he, his own affections' counsellor,
		And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
		I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
I will be cruel with the maids,
		He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
		Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
divides their families,
		Romeo. Not I, believe me. you have dancing shoes,
		Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
		And if you be not of the house of Montagues,
		Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
		I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
Mercutio. You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
		Pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his,
		This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
Sampson. True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
		Servant. Away with the join-stools,
		Mercutio. True, I talk of dreams,
		Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
		Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
		Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
		And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
		So shall you share all that he doth possess,
		And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
		Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
		Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
		While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
		These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
		Romeo. What lady is that,
		Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
		It is my will; the which if thou respect,
		But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
		What is it else? a madness most discreet,
		Examine every married lineament,
		Romeo. A torch for me. let wantons, light of heart,
		But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
		Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
		Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
		This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
		That I will show you shining at this feast,
		Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
		Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Romeo. Out,
		Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
		Lady Capulet.Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
		With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
Benvolio. Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
		Compare her face with some that I shall show,
		Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
		Shake, quoth the dove-house. 'twas no need, I trow,
Servant. Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I pray,
		Benvolio. Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
		From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
		So far from sounding and discovery,
		That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
		Two households, both alike in dignity,
		For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
		Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
		We have a trifling foolish banquet towards..

		Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.
Escalus, Prince of Verona.
		With all the admired beauties of Verona.
		My lord and you were then at Mantua.
		Some five-and-twenty years; and then we mask'd.
		And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd.
		From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
		Capulet. He shall be endur'd.
		Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
Benvolio. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
Romeo. Stay, fellow; I can read.
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
		More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
My grave is like to be my wedding-bed.
I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
Sampson. I strike quickly, being moved.
		Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid.
		A was a merry man, took up the child.
		Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
		And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Sampson. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand.
Sampson. A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
Gregory. To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand.
		What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
And soar with them above a common bound.
		Shut up in prison, kept without my food.
		For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood.
		And stole into the covert of the wood.
		Mercutio. Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word.
		And like her most whose merit most shall be.
		Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
		For men so old as we to keep the peace.
Lady Capulet. Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
A public place.
		To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
		Then dreams he of another benefice.
		Lies my consent and fair according voice.
Mercutio. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
		After the prompter, for our entrance.
		And hear the sentence of your moved Prince.
Paris, a young Nobleman, Kinsman to the Prince.
Paris. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
		Capulet. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
		For fair without the fair within to hide.
		Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Sampson. My naked weapon is out. quarrel! I will back thee.
Lady Capulet.We follow thee.
		Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
		Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
Page to Paris; another Page.
		Making them women of good carriage.
Romeo. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
		To bid me trudge.
		This is she.
		And the rank poison of the old will die.
		And these,who, often drown'd, could never die.
Mercutio. That dreamers often lie.
Abraham. You lie.
Juliet. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Romeo.Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
Gregory. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
Or manage it to part these men with me.
		Come, go with me.
		And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
Lady Capulet. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
		Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
Sampson. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
Tybalt. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
		You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Benvolio. But new struck nine.
		I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
		The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
		We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
Nurse. Anon, anon! Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
		Such as would please; 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.
		May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Lady Montague. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
		I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
		Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
Juliet. Madam, I am here.
Romeo. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
		To meet her new beloved anywhere.
		Capulet. But saying o'er what I have said before.
Romeo. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
		To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
		One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
		That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Peter, Servant to Juliet's Nurse.
A Hall in Capulet's House.
Room in Capulet's House.
		Her mother is the lady of the house.
Servant. To supper; to our house.
		Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
		Remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.
		Tybalt. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Lady Montague, Wife to Montague.
Romeo, Son to Montague.
Abraham, Servant to Montague.
Romeo. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Romeo. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
		Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Romeo. Out of her favour where I am in love.
		The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
		Juliet. I'll look to like, if looking liking move.
		So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
		Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
		Herself pois'd with herself in either eye.
Lady Capulet. Marry, that marry is the very theme I came to talk of.
Juliet. It is an honour that I dream not of.
Hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Thou talk'st of nothing.
		Servant. Now I'll tell you without asking.
		Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning.
		Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
Romeo. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
		And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
Benvolio. Soft! I will go along.
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
		And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
		Capulet.What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much.
		Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.
And 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
		One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
		An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
		By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
		She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
		Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
		To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
Romeo. O, teach me how I should forget to think.
		Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Juliet.You kiss by the book.
Juliet.Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
iet perennially topical.
		I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Cheerly, boys; be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
		Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
		Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
Benvolio. He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall.
Montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
Gregory. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall.
		Let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
		Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
		That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
I'll not endure him.
		The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
Montague. I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Benvolio. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
Benvolio. Strike, drum.

		Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
An open place adjoining Capulet's Garden.
		Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Lady Capulet. She's not fourteen.
Gregory. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Gregory. Say better; here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
Give me my sin again.
		Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again.
Sampson. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Romeo. For your broken shin.
		To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
		Romeo. Why, such is love's transgression.
Benvolio. At thy good heart's oppression.
		So early walking did I see your son.
		Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
		Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
		Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
		Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
		Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
		I would not for the wealth of all the town.
Gregory. No.
Benvolio. Part, fools! put up your swords; you know not what you do.
Tybalt. 'Tis he, that villain, Romeo.
Mercutio, Kinsman to the Prince and Friend to Romeo.
Benvolio, Nephew to Montague and Friend to Romeo.
Balthasar, Servant to Romeo.
		Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go.
Montague. Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.
But 'tis no wit to go.
His son was but a ward two years ago.
		Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.
But sadly tell me who.
Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
Call, good Mercutio.
Servant. We cannot be here and there too.
		Mercutio. Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo. Nay, that's not so.
		Am I the master here, or you? go to.
Servant. Up.
		thwart men's noses as they lie asleep.
Benvolio. No, coz, I rather weep.
Gregory. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
Servant. You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for in the great chamber.
An Officer.
Friar John, of the same Order.
		I tell you, he that can lay hold of her.
Benvolio. Be rul'd by me, forget to think of her.
Montague, Heads of two Houses at variance with each other.
Nurse. Your mother.
Abraham. No better.
		To beautify him, only lacks a cover.
Lady Capulet.Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.
Juliet. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
		With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
		To merit bliss by making me despair.
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Sampson. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
Sampson. I do bite my thumb, sir.
Sampson. Well, sir.
Abraham. Quarrel, sir! no, sir.
Sampson. Yes, better, sir.
Servant. I know not, sir.
Chor.
Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
Servant. My master's.
I will cut off their heads.
		Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.
Examine other beauties.

Benvolio. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.

But every man betake him to his legs.
		Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.

		This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
		This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this.
		Shall have the chinks.
		And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
Sampson. Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
		A hall,a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
Three Musicians.
		Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
Second Capulet. By'r Lady, thirty years.
Gregory. No, for then we should be colliers.
		Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
		By having him, making yourself no less.
		And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
		To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
		Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
		I'll make you quiet. What! cheerly, my hearts.
		And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
Chorus.
		As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
Lady Capulet. A fortnight and odd days.
Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Servant. Juliet, the county stays.
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
Romeo. Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.
		This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
Benvolio. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
A Street.
A Street.

		A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
		Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

Tybalt, Nephew to Lady Capulet.
		I must hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
		Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
		And makes himself an artificial night.
		For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
		To scorn at our solemnity this night.
		And in this state she gallops night by night.
		I thank you, honest gentlemen, good-night.
Romeo. I dreamt a dream to-night.
Gregory. They must take it in sense that feel it.
Which is disgrace to them if they bear it.
		And she was wean'd, I never shall forget it.
Benvolio. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
Sampson. 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant.
		Here in my house do him disparagement.
		And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Sampson. Fear me not.
		He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.
Nurse. I know not.
		Till the prince came, who parted either part.
		Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
Romeo. Not having that which, having, makes them short.
		An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
Benvolio. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
		And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
		I'll to my rest.
Romeo. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Tybalt. It fits, when such a villain is a guest.
Gregory. I will frown as I pass by; and let them take it as they list.
		The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
		Mercutio. O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
		Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
Sampson. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
Sampson. I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.
Sampson. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
		Whipp'd and tormented and God-den, good fellow.
		Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
		We would as willingly give cure as know.
		For even the day before, she broke her brow.
		And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
As all the world why he's a man of wax.
		Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
		We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
		You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
		Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
		My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
		For this time, all the rest depart away.
Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
Servant. Ay, boy, ready.
		A fair assembly.
		Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
		A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.
		That I must love a loathed enemy.
The only son of your great enemy.
An Apothecary.
Romeo. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
		The pantry, and everything in extremity.
		Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
		Benvolio. The date is out of such prolixity.
His son is thirty.
		Farewell, my coz.
		The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
		The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
		A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
		Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
		Were of an age. well, Susan is with God;
Benvolio. See, where he comes. so please you step aside;
		A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
		Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
		Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
		I never should forget it; 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
		The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
		You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
		Capulet. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
		A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
		Tybalt. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
		For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
Mercutio. He is wise;
		Ah, sirrah [to Second Capulet], by my fay, it waxes late;
		Romeo. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
		Cry but 'Ah me!' pronounce but Love and dove;
		Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
		Mercutio. If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Mercutio. And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
		That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
		And private in his chamber pens himself;
Romeo. Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
		One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
		Paris.Of honourable reckoning are you both;
Romeo. And we mean well, in going to this mask;
		I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal;
		Is it e'en so? why then, I thank you all;
		Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
Sampson. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
		Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
		He bears him like a portly gentleman;
		On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
		And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
		We must talk in secret:-Nurse, come back again;
		I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
Romeo. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
Benvolio. Groan! why, no;
		Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
		To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear;
		Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
		Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
		And young affection gapes to be his heir;
Second Capulet. 'Tis more, 'tis more. his son is elder, sir;
Sampson. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
		Montague. Both by myself and many other friends;
		O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
		Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
		Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
Citizens of Veroral Men and Women, relations to both houses;
		Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Benvolio. By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
		Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
		Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
		Romeo. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
		Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
		Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
		Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
		The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
		With purple fountains issuing from your veins;
		She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
		And since that time it is eleven years;
		'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
		The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
		Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
		Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets;
		For you and I are past our dancing days;
		My master is the great rich Capulet;
		Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
		O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight;
		That plats the manes of horses in the night;
		And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
		Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
		With Cupid's arrow, she hath Dian's wit;
		And see how one another lends content;
		My will to her consent is but a part;
		Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
		This night you shall behold him at our feast;
		Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast;
		She could have run and waddled all about;
		And to them say;
		That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
		Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
Servant. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
Benvolio. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
		You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?
Lady Capulet. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
		'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
		'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
Juliet.What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
		To Lammas-tide?
Romeo. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Benvolio. For what, I pray thee?
Can you read anything you see?
		whither should they come?
		Where shall we dine? O,me! What fray was here?
Romeo. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Benvolio. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Romeo. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Romeo. Whose house?
Benvolio. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Lady Capulet. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Benvolio. Of love?
Benvolio. In love?
Benvolio. Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
Benvolio. Good morrow, cousin. Romeo. Is the day so young?
		Montague. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
		Dost thou not laugh?
Mercutio. Why, may one ask?
		Were in a mask?
What is your will?
		Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
Juliet. Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?
		Lady Capulet.What say you? can you love the gentleman?
Gregory. How! turn thy back and run?
Romeo. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Capulet.Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
		What, goodman boy! I say he shall go to?
Romeo. Whither?
Romeo. What is her mother?
		Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Gregory. Do you quarrel, sir?
Abraham. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Abraham. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Juliet. What's he that now is going out of door?
Gregory. The heads of the maids?
Tybalt. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
		What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Nurse. What's this? What's this?
Juliet. How now, who calls?
Benvolio. Have you importun'd him by any means?
Benvolio. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Romeo. Well, what was yours?
Capulet. Will you tell me that?
Romeo. Good heart, at what?
Romeo. Is she a Capulet?
		Of yonder knight?
Capulet.Young Romeo, is it?
		But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
		She, I'll swear hath corns; am I come near you now?
Sampson. Is the law of our side if I say ay?
		Lady Montague. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
Servant. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
Or shall we on without apology?
		To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
